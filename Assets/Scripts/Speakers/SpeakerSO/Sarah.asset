  speakerName: Sarah Morales
  speakerBackStory: "Before the vault doors sealed, Sarah worked as a pharmacy assistant
    in a small town clinic. Not a full nurse, but she picked up a ton just by being
    around the chaos\u2014wound cleaning, setting broken bones, keeping people calm
    under pressure. When the world went sideways, she was already used to surviving
    quietly in crisis.  She was offered a place in the vault because she volunteered
    at the local emergency shelter during the first wave of evacuations. She didn't
    have connections or cash\u2014just grit, quick hands, and a reputation for keeping
    her cool."
  speakerPersonality: "Sarah\u2019s calm, but not cold. She\u2019s observant, often
    the one to notice when someone\u2019s limping or hiding a cough. There\u2019s
    a weight behind her eyes, like she\u2019s always thinking three steps ahead.
    But she\u2019s kind in a quiet way\u2014gives you an extra spoon of food if you\u2019re
    down, or checks in on folks without making a scene.  She doesn\u2019t trust easily,
    but she isn\u2019t paranoid either. She\u2019s just learned to keep her ears
    open and her cards close. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be in her circle, you\u2019ll
    know it. She protects her people. Her personality Sarah should always be: skeptical,
    critical thinker, does not trust what people say at face value.\r\n"
  speakerAction: She wants to help the player understand the situation, she can go
    away if the player asked her to leave, she wont show him around much.
